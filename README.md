# About
This is the program for mining KAE (it's not really a cryptocurrency though) I wrote to learn OpenCL.\
It's based on the official CPU miner written in C# - https://github.com/kolya5544/KAEMiner

# Build
Install needed dependencies (curl, jsoncpp and opencl) and type:\
```make```

# How to use
Use the following syntax:\
```./miner address```
